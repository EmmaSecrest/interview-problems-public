# Welcome!

## Getting Started

Share your screen during the exercise

Feel free to use MDN/docs, just don't google the solution

## Coding

If you're doing the code+test problems, you can also try to fork the problem on
codecollab without installing any dependencies:

- https://codecollab.io/@xdumaine/json-stringify
- https://codecollab.io/@xdumaine/promise-all

Occasionally codecollab runs out of compilers, so just run it locally:

`yarn install` or `npm install` to get started

To run test for code problems, run `yarn test <problem-name>`:

`yarn test promise-all.ts`

`yarn test json-stringify.ts`

To run the UI exercise: ---- todo ----
